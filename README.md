## Tech Stack

SellZone is built using a powerful and modern stack:

  * **Frontend:**
      * **React.js:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
      * **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
      * **Vite:** A lightning-fast build tool and development server, providing instant hot module replacement (HMR).
      * **Styling:** [e.g., Tailwind CSS, Material UI, styled-components, plain CSS Modules - *Specify what you use*]
  * **Backend:**
      * [e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Django/Flask, Firebase, Supabase - *Crucial: Specify your backend here*]
  * **Database:**
      * [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firestore, MySQL - *Crucial: Specify your database here*]
  * **Other Libraries/Tools:**
      * [e.g., Axios for API calls, React Router DOM for navigation, Zod for validation, Resend for email sending, etc. - *List any other significant ones*]

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run SellZone locally on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/install) (npm is usually bundled with Node.js)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/sellzone.git
    cd sellzone
    ```

2.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project.

      * **For Frontend (Vite):** Variables must be prefixed with `VITE_`.
        ```env
        VITE_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
        # Add any other frontend-specific environment variables here (e.g., VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY)
        ```
      * **For Backend (if applicable):** Create a separate `.env` file in your backend directory (e.g., `backend/.env`).
        ```env
        PORT=3000
        DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
        RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key # As seen in your previous code
        # Add other backend-specific secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET, Cloudinary_API_KEY)
        ```
      * **Note:** Replace placeholders with your actual values. Consult your backend documentation for required variables.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev
    ```

    The frontend application will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port Vite chooses).

2.  **Start the Backend Server (if separate):**
    Navigate to your backend directory and start it.

    ```bash
    cd backend # or whatever your backend folder is called
    npm install # if not already done
    npm start   # or node server.js, yarn dev, etc. - depends on your backend setup
    ```

    Your backend API will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port you configured).
